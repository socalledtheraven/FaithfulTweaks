# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for contributing to the resource pack! This guide will show you how to contribute your changes or additions to the project.

## Basic guidelines
- textures need to have the right file name and file path
- they should be the double resolution of the original image
- describe what you added/changed
- **they should be tested and need to actually work**


### Adding block textures
- all complete textures are located in the "Block Textures" folder
- your block texture should have the right file name as in the "DEFAULT Block Textures" folder
- if you're finished, delete the default block in the default textures folder


### Adding other textures
- all other textures are located in the "UE4Project/Content" folder
- some textures may also need models, if so you need to correctly add them too
- if you actually don't know how to change models, then mention in the description
